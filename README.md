## Getting Started

- From the repo root folder run

```js
  npm install
  npm start
```

## How we are going to test your API
- We start your API locally by running the following:

```js
  npm install
  npm start
```

- Using Postman we will make a GET request to the following URL:

```
  http://localhost:3000/
```

- If the bonus round has been completed will make the following GET requests:

```
  http://localhost:3000/sort?order=asc
  http://localhost:3000/sort?order=dsc
```
